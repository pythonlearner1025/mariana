# Mariana - deep research agent
Many of humanity's best ideas have been interdisciplinary: for example, deep learning was ushered in by researchers with deep interests in cognitive science and computer science. 
However, the type of mind that can synthesize insights across domains is rare. 
Fundamentally, biological limits constrain us from performing sweeping synthesis across multiple domains. 
AI need not take on our faults. 
Mariana explores the exciting possibility of using AI to synthesize research between any number of subjects.

# design philosophy
- should be useful
- quality of research should scale with spend budget
- information loaded into context must be diverse and high quality 

# observations
- claude3-opus gets argument types wrong ~50% when using tools (functions)
- quality of report with first 3 pages of papers in context >> only abstract of papers in context 

# TODO
- [ ] how to measure quality vs. $ burn? 
- [ ] continued learning: use memory & improve report
- [ ] clean pdf readings 
- [ ] gpt4 & Mixtral integration
